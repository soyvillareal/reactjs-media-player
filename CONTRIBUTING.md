npm install # or yarn
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

## Linting

This project uses [standard](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) code style. Be sure to lint the code after making changes and fix any issues that come up.

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Testing

This project uses [Jest](https://github.com/jestjs/jest) with [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) and [ESBuild Jest](https://github.com/aelbore/esbuild-jest) for testing in the browser. Be sure to test `ReactJS Media Player` after making changes and, if youâ€™re feeling generous, add some tests of your own.

```bash
npm test
